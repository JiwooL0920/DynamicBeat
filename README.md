A study repo to build a rhythm game in Java as a personal project to learn Java programming during summer break; followed online tutorials provided [here](https://blog.naver.com/ndb796/220997028385).

**Note:** This game may not run properly on Mac platforms as Java Swing is built primarily to run based on Widnows platform's look and feel.
